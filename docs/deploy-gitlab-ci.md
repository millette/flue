# Build Agents for GitLab CI/CD

Build and run Flue agents in GitLab CI/CD pipelines. This guide walks you through creating your first agent, running it locally with the CLI, and wiring it into a pipeline.

By the end, you will have a Flue agent running inside GitLab CI/CD, and you will know how to use agent definitions, bundled skills, external CLIs, subagents, and typed results to build CI workflows.

## Hello World

A minimal agent that runs in CI whenever an issue is opened.

### 1. Set up your project

```bash
mkdir my-flue-project && cd my-flue-project
npm init -y
npm install @flue/runtime valibot
npm install -D @flue/cli
```

### 2. Create your first agent

`.flue/actions/hello.ts`:

```typescript
import type { ActionContext } from '@flue/runtime';
import { local } from '@flue/runtime/node';
import * as v from 'valibot';

export const triggers = {};

export default async function ({ init, payload }: ActionContext) {
  const harness = await init({ sandbox: local(), model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6' });
  const session = await harness.session();

  const { data } = await session.prompt(
    `Say hello to ${payload.name ?? 'the user'} and share an interesting fact.`,
    {
      result: v.object({
        greeting: v.string(),
        fact: v.string(),
      }),
    },
  );

  return data;
}
```

A few things to note:

- **`triggers = {}`** — This agent has no HTTP trigger. It's designed to be run from the CLI, which is perfect for CI.
- **`model`** — Every session needs a model. If you do not pass one to `init()` or a specific `prompt()` / `skill()` call, no model is chosen.
- **`local()`** — The `local()` sandbox runs the agent directly against the host filesystem and shell. In CI, that's the checked-out repo plus whatever binaries are on `$PATH` (`glab`, `git`, `npm`, etc.). Agent definitions and bundled skills still come from your Flue source code; sandbox context loading is an optional separate feature. By default only shell-essential env vars (`PATH`, `HOME`, locale, etc.) are inherited from `process.env` — pass `local({ env: { GITLAB_TOKEN: process.env.GITLAB_TOKEN } })` to expose more. Use `local()` only when the runner itself provides the isolation boundary.
- **Schemas** — The [Valibot](https://valibot.dev) schema defines the expected output shape. Flue parses the agent's response and returns it on `response.data`, fully typed.

### 3. Test it locally

```bash
npx flue run hello --target node --id test-1 \
  --payload '{"name": "World"}'
```

`flue run` builds the project, starts a temporary server, invokes the agent, streams progress to stderr, and prints the final result as JSON to stdout. This is the fastest way to iterate on an agent — no deployment needed.

### 4. Wire it into GitLab CI/CD

`.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
hello:
  image: node:22
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "trigger" && $ISSUE_ACTION == "open"
  before_script:
    - npm ci
  script:
    - |
      npx flue run hello --target node \
        --id "hello-$ISSUE_IID" \
        --payload "{\"name\": \"$ISSUE_AUTHOR\"}"
```

#### Triggering pipelines from issue events

GitLab doesn't pass issue data into CI variables automatically. You need a [pipeline trigger](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/triggers/) to bridge the gap:

1. Create a pipeline trigger token: **Settings > CI/CD > Pipeline trigger tokens**
2. Add a project webhook (**Settings > Webhooks**) that fires on **Issue events**, pointing at a small relay that calls the trigger API with the right variables:

```typescript
// Deploy as a serverless function or lightweight server
async function handleGitLabWebhook(event) {
  const { object_kind, object_attributes, issue } = event;
  let variables: Record<string, string> = {};

  if (object_kind === 'issue') {
    variables = {
      ISSUE_ACTION: object_attributes.action,
      ISSUE_IID: String(object_attributes.iid),
      ISSUE_AUTHOR: object_attributes.author?.username ?? '',
    };
  } else if (object_kind === 'note' && issue) {
    variables = {
      ISSUE_ACTION: 'note',
      ISSUE_IID: String(issue.iid),
    };
  } else {
    return;
  }

  await fetch(`${GITLAB_URL}/api/v4/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/trigger/pipeline`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ token: TRIGGER_TOKEN, ref: 'main', variables }),
  });
}
```

Once wired up, open an issue and you'll see a passing pipeline with the agent's greeting in the logs.

## Building a real agent

Now let's build something useful — an issue triage agent that analyzes an issue and reports back. This is where Flue's agent features start to shine.

### The action handler

The action handler is where orchestration lives. The `ActionContext` gives you everything you need: `init()` to create a session, `payload` for input data, and `env` for environment bindings.

Once you have a session, you have three core methods:

- **`session.shell(cmd)`** — Run a shell command in the sandbox. Returns `{ stdout, stderr, exitCode }`.
- **`session.prompt(text, opts)`** — Send a prompt to the agent and get back a result.
- **`session.skill(skillValue, opts)`** — Run a bundled Agent Skills `SKILL.md` value. String names are also supported for opt-in sandbox-discovered skills.

Both `prompt()` and `skill()` accept a `result` option — a [Valibot](https://valibot.dev) schema that defines the expected output shape. Flue parses the agent's response and returns it on `response.data`, fully typed:

```typescript
import reproduceIssue from '../skills/reproduce-issue/SKILL.md' with { type: 'skill' };
import * as v from 'valibot';

// summary: string
const { data: summary } = await session.prompt(`Summarize this diff:\n${diff}`, {
  result: v.string(),
});

// diagnosis: { reproducible: boolean, skipped: boolean }
const { data: diagnosis } = await session.skill(reproduceIssue, {
  args: { issueIid, issue },
  result: v.object({
    reproducible: v.boolean(),
    skipped: v.boolean(),
  }),
});
```

### Connecting external CLIs

Your agent often needs to interact with external tools. With `local()`, the agent's bash tool runs against the host shell directly — anything on `$PATH` is reachable. Host env vars are opt-in: only shell essentials (`PATH`, `HOME`, locale, etc.) are inherited by default, so you pass the specific vars your CLIs need via `local({ env: { ... } })`.

In GitLab CI, this means you set the secrets you want the agent's CLIs to see in the job's `variables:` block (or as masked CI/CD variables), then forward them explicitly into the sandbox. The runner is your isolation boundary; flue makes the inner boundary (host → spawned shell) explicit.

`.flue/actions/triage.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineAgent, type ActionContext } from '@flue/runtime';
import reproduceIssue from '../skills/reproduce-issue/SKILL.md' with { type: 'skill' };
import { local } from '@flue/runtime/node';
import * as v from 'valibot';

export const triggers = {};

const triageAgent = defineAgent({
  name: 'issue-triage',
  model: 'anthropic/claude-opus-4-7',
  instructions: 'Triage GitLab issues carefully. Use the available reproduction skill before deciding severity.',
  skills: [reproduceIssue],
});

export default async function ({ init, payload }: ActionContext) {
  const harness = await init({
    agent: triageAgent,
    sandbox: local({ env: { GITLAB_TOKEN: process.env.GITLAB_TOKEN } }),
  });
  const session = await harness.session();

  const reproduction = await session.skill(reproduceIssue, {
    args: { issueIid: payload.issueIid, projectId: payload.projectId },
    result: v.object({ reproducible: v.boolean(), notes: v.string() }),
  });
  const { data } = await session.prompt(`Complete triage for issue ${payload.issueIid}.\n\nReproduction notes: ${reproduction.data.notes}`, {
    result: v.object({
      severity: v.picklist(['low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical']),
      reproducible: v.boolean(),
      summary: v.string(),
      fix_applied: v.boolean(),
    }),
  });

  return data;
}
```

If you want a tighter boundary — the agent can call a specific operation but never see the underlying token — wrap the operation as a custom tool with `init({ tools: [...] })`. The tool implementation reads the secret from `process.env`; the agent only sees the tool's parameters and result.

### Bundled skills and subagents

Treat a full triage workflow as an agent. Smaller reusable playbooks become bundled skills the agent can run as explicit steps. For example, the action above imports this skill into `triageAgent`:

`.flue/skills/reproduce-issue/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: reproduce-issue
description: Attempt to reproduce a GitLab issue before severity is assigned.
---

Use the issue IID and project ID from the arguments. Inspect the report with `glab issue view`, read relevant project files, and run only the smallest commands needed to confirm whether the behavior reproduces. Return concise notes and whether reproduction succeeded.
```

If triage needs a specialist, add a subagent:

```typescript
const patchAuthor = defineAgent({
  name: 'patch-author',
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6',
  instructions: 'Propose the smallest safe patch after triage is complete.',
});

const triageAgent = defineAgent({
  name: 'issue-triage',
  model: 'anthropic/claude-opus-4-7',
  skills: [reproduceIssue],
  subagents: [patchAuthor],
});

await session.task('Draft a patch for this reproduced issue.', { agent: patchAuthor });
```

`loadFromSandbox: true` is available for advanced cases where an action intentionally consumes repo-local `AGENTS.md` or sandbox skills, but this guide's primary shape keeps the agent and its skills in the Flue source tree so they build and deploy together.

### Wiring it into GitLab CI/CD

`.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
triage:
  image: node:22
  timeout: 30 minutes
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "trigger" && $ISSUE_ACTION == "open"
  before_script:
    - npm ci
  script:
    - |
      npx flue run triage --target node \
        --id "triage-$ISSUE_IID" \
        --payload "{\"issueIid\": $ISSUE_IID, \"projectId\": \"$CI_PROJECT_ID\"}"
```

Add these as CI/CD variables (**Settings > CI/CD > Variables**, masked):

| Variable            | Description                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | API key for your LLM provider                     |
| `GITLAB_API_TOKEN`  | Project or personal access token with `api` scope |

## Typed results and orchestration

Result schemas aren't just for type safety — they're how you orchestrate multi-step workflows. Because you get typed data back from `prompt()` and `skill()`, you can branch on results within a single agent:

```typescript
import { type ActionContext } from '@flue/runtime';
import autoFix from '../skills/auto-fix/SKILL.md' with { type: 'skill' };
import reproduceIssue from '../skills/reproduce-issue/SKILL.md' with { type: 'skill' };
import { local } from '@flue/runtime/node';
import * as v from 'valibot';

export default async function ({ init, payload }: ActionContext) {
  const harness = await init({
    sandbox: local(),
    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6',
    skills: [reproduceIssue, autoFix],
  });
  const session = await harness.session();
  const { data } = await session.skill(reproduceIssue, {
    args: { issueIid: payload.issueIid },
    result: v.object({ severity: v.picklist(['low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical']), reproducible: v.boolean(), summary: v.string() }),
  });

  if (data.severity === 'critical' && data.reproducible) {
    await session.skill(autoFix, {
      args: { issueIid: payload.issueIid },
      result: v.object({ fix_applied: v.boolean(), branch: v.optional(v.string()) }),
    });
  }

  return data;
}
```

This pattern — prompt or skill call, check the result, decide what to do next — is how you build sophisticated agents that go beyond single-shot prompts.

## Running actions locally

During development, `flue run` is your main tool. It builds the project and runs the action in one step:

```bash
# Run with a payload
npx flue run triage --target node --id test-1 \
  --payload '{"issueIid": 42, "projectId": "123"}'

# Pipe the result to jq
npx flue run triage --target node --id test-2 \
  --payload '{"issueIid": 42}' | jq '.severity'
```

The CLI builds your project root, starts a temporary server, invokes the action via SSE, streams progress to stderr, and prints the final result to stdout. The `--id` flag identifies the action instance — use a consistent ID to resume the default harness/session, or a unique one for a fresh start.
